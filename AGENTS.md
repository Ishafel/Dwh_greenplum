# Project Notes for AI Assistants

## Overview

This repository contains a local DWH stack built with Docker Compose:

- PostgreSQL as the operational/source database.
- Greenplum 6.27.1 as the main PostgreSQL-compatible DWH engine.
- Hive Metastore 3.1.3 for the minimal Hive/PXF contour.
- Apache NiFi 2.8.0 for data flows.
- ClickHouse for analytical/event-style storage.
- Liquibase containers for PostgreSQL, Greenplum, and ClickHouse schema migrations.
- `gpfdist` for serving local landing-zone files to Greenplum external tables.
- PXF inside the Greenplum container for Hive external tables.

Prefer reading `README.md` first when a task touches operations, ports, credentials,
or manual commands. Keep this file as the compact working guide.

## Current Data Model

PostgreSQL migrations currently create:

- `dm` schema.

Greenplum migrations currently create:

- `dwh` schema.
- `ext` schema for external tables.
- `stg` schema for staging tables.
- `ext.example_customers_raw` reading CSV files from
  `gpfdist://gpfdist:8081/example_customers/*.csv`.
- `stg.example_customers` distributed by `customer_id`.

The `pxf-examples` service currently creates:

- `ext.example_hive_customers_pxf` reading Hive `demo.example_hive_customers` through
  `pxf://demo.example_hive_customers?PROFILE=Hive&SERVER=hive`.

Hive init currently creates:

- `demo.example_hive_customers` external text table over files in `/opt/hive/data/warehouse/example_hive_customers`.

ClickHouse migrations currently create:

- `example_events` with `MergeTree` and `ORDER BY (event_time, event_id)`.

## Common Commands

Start or rebuild the full local stack:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Stop the full local stack:

```bash
docker compose down
```

Run PostgreSQL migrations manually:

```bash
docker compose build liquibase-postgres
docker compose run --rm liquibase-postgres
```

Run Greenplum migrations manually:

```bash
docker compose build liquibase-greenplum
docker compose run --rm liquibase-greenplum
```

Create or refresh sample PXF external tables manually:

```bash
docker compose run --rm pxf-examples
```

Run ClickHouse migrations manually:

```bash
docker compose build liquibase-clickhouse
docker compose run --rm liquibase-clickhouse
```

Open PostgreSQL `psql` inside the container:

```bash
docker compose exec postgres psql -U app -d app
```

Open Greenplum `psql` inside the container:

```bash
docker compose exec -u gpadmin gpdb /usr/local/greenplum-db/bin/psql -d gpdb
```

Check PXF status:

```bash
docker compose exec -u gpadmin gpdb bash -lc 'source ~/.bashrc && pxf cluster status'
```

Check Hive sample through Greenplum PXF:

```bash
docker compose exec -u gpadmin gpdb /usr/local/greenplum-db/bin/psql -d gpdb -Atc "SELECT count(*) FROM ext.example_hive_customers_pxf;"
```

Open ClickHouse client inside the container:

```bash
docker compose exec clickhouse clickhouse-client --user dwh --password dwhpw --database dwh
```

Check service status and logs:

```bash
docker compose ps
docker compose logs -f postgres
docker compose logs -f gpdb
docker compose logs -f clickhouse
docker compose logs -f nifi
```

## Validation

Run the fast repository checks first:

```bash
make test
```

`./scripts/test.sh` is available as a compatibility wrapper around `make test`.

These checks validate Docker Compose syntax, documented environment variables, Liquibase
migration conventions, Greenplum distribution clauses, ClickHouse engine/order clauses,
gpfdist sample data, and executable shell entrypoints.

When the Docker Compose stack is already running, use `make test-stack` for integration
checks against live PostgreSQL, Greenplum, ClickHouse, and NiFi services. This target is
expected to fail when containers are not running. Stack checks read `.env` and fall back
to the same defaults as `docker-compose.yml`.

For schema or stack changes, also validate with the smallest relevant Docker Compose commands:

- For PostgreSQL migration changes, build and run `liquibase-postgres`.
- For Greenplum migration changes, build and run `liquibase-greenplum`.
- For PXF changes, start the stack, run `pxf cluster status`, run `pxf-examples`, and
  query `ext.example_hive_customers_pxf`.
- For Hive PXF changes, also start `hive-metastore`, run `hive-init`, and verify
  `demo.example_hive_customers`.
- For ClickHouse migration changes, build and run `liquibase-clickhouse`.
- For Dockerfile or Compose changes, run `docker compose config` and, when practical,
  `docker compose up -d --build`.
- For landing-zone or external-table changes, query the external table through `psql`.

Some Docker builds download JDBC drivers from Maven Central, so they require network
access.

## Migration Rules

- Add new PostgreSQL migrations as separate YAML files in
  `liquibase-postgres/changelog/migrations/`.
- Add new Greenplum migrations as separate YAML files in
  `liquibase-greenplum/changelog/migrations/`.
- Add new ClickHouse migrations as separate YAML files in
  `liquibase-clickhouse/changelog/migrations/`.
- Keep migration filenames ordered with a numeric prefix, for example
  `0004-create-some-table.yaml`.
- Do not rewrite migrations that may already have been applied unless the user explicitly
  asks for a local reset or confirms it is safe.
- Keep `changeSet.id` values stable after a migration is introduced.
- Use `splitStatements: false` for multi-statement SQL blocks or SQL that Liquibase might
  split incorrectly.
- For Greenplum tables, specify `DISTRIBUTED BY (...)` deliberately.
- For ClickHouse tables, specify the engine explicitly, usually with `ORDER BY (...)`.

## PostgreSQL Notes

- The local PostgreSQL container exposes `${POSTGRES_PORT:-5434}` on the host and uses
  port `5432` inside Docker.
- Defaults are database `app`, user `app`, password `apppw`.
- PostgreSQL source data is migrated by `liquibase-postgres`.
- The `postgres_data` Docker volume stores PostgreSQL data files. Do not remove it
  unless the user explicitly approves.

## Greenplum Notes

- The local Greenplum container exposes `${GREENPLUM_PORT:-5433}` on the host and uses
  port `5432` inside Docker.
- Defaults are database `gpdb`, user `gpadmin`, password `gpadminpw`.
- The cluster is initialized as one Docker node with 4 primary segments.
- PXF is enabled by default with `GREENPLUM_PXF_ENABLE=true` and exposed as
  `${PXF_PORT:-5888}` on the host.
- PXF server configs in `/data/pxf/servers/` are rebuilt from `greenplum/pxf/servers/`
  by `greenplum/init-4-segments.sh` on each `gpdb` start. If PXF was already prepared,
  the script runs `pxf cluster sync` after rebuilding configs. On first PXF bootstrap,
  the script waits until `pxf cluster prepare` creates `/data/pxf/conf/pxf-env.sh` before
  copying server configs, so `/data/pxf` is not made non-empty before prepare. If a previous
  failed start left only stale `/data/pxf/servers`, the script removes only that config
  directory and retries normal PXF prepare. If `/data/pxf` has another partial state without
  `pxf-env.sh`, the script disables PXF for that start so Greenplum can still become healthy.
  If the server config changes while PXF is already running, restart `gpdb` or rebuild the
  config directory and run `pxf cluster sync && pxf cluster restart` inside `gpdb`.
- If the segment count or initialization shape changes, the `gpdata` Docker volume may
  need to be recreated. Do not remove volumes unless the user explicitly approves.
- `gpfdist` serves `data/landing` on port `${GPFDIST_PORT:-8081}`.
- Inside Docker, Greenplum reads landing files with URLs like
  `gpfdist://gpfdist:8081/<folder>/*.csv`.

## ClickHouse Notes

- HTTP port defaults to `8123`; native port defaults to `9000`.
- Defaults are database `dwh`, user `dwh`, password `dwhpw`.
- ClickHouse Liquibase uses the ClickHouse JDBC driver plus the GoodforGod Liquibase
  ClickHouse extension.

## Hive Notes

- Hive Metastore exposes `${HIVE_METASTORE_PORT:-9083}`.
- The Hive image is pinned to `${HIVE_PLATFORM:-linux/amd64}` because the official
  `apache/hive:3.1.3` image is amd64-only.
- The metastore uses embedded Derby stored in the `hive_metastore_db` Docker volume.
- Hive table files are stored in the `hive_warehouse` Docker volume and mounted into
  Greenplum at `/opt/hive/data/warehouse` so PXF can read local-file Hive table data.
- The Docker default network is explicitly named `dwh-greenplum`; this avoids underscores
  in reverse-DNS hostnames, which Hive 3 rejects when resolving Metastore URIs.

## NiFi Notes

- NiFi UI is available at `https://localhost:8443/nifi`.
- Defaults are user `admin` and password `GreenplumNiFi123`.
- PostgreSQL JDBC driver path inside NiFi:
  `/opt/nifi/jdbc/postgresql.jar`.
- ClickHouse JDBC driver path inside NiFi:
  `/opt/nifi/jdbc/clickhouse.jar`.
- The landing directory is mounted in NiFi as `/data/landing`.

## Deploy Notes

Deployment is handled by `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` on pushes to `main` and manual
workflow dispatch, but only for repository `Ishafel/Dwh` on `refs/heads/main`.

The workflow expects a self-hosted Linux runner with label `dwh-greenplum` and runs:

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

`scripts/deploy.sh` expects:

- `APP_DIR=/mnt/bulk/dwh_greenplum`
- `EXPECTED_DOCKER_ROOT=/mnt/bulk/docker`

The deploy script refuses to continue if tracked local changes exist in `APP_DIR`.
It uses `git pull --ff-only origin main`, then `docker compose up -d --build`, then
checks service status, row counts for PostgreSQL, Greenplum, and ClickHouse, and NiFi health.

## Dangerous Areas

- Do not delete Docker volumes such as `postgres_data`, `gpdata`, `clickhouse_data`, or NiFi volumes without
  explicit user approval.
- Do not run broad cleanup commands or destructive Git commands without explicit user
  approval.
- Do not commit real secrets. Use `.env.example` only for safe documented defaults.
- Be careful when changing exposed ports or credentials: README, `.env.example`,
  `docker-compose.yml`, NiFi connection notes, and deploy behavior may all need updates.
- Be careful with `scripts/deploy.sh`; it is used by the production-like deployment path.

## Style

- Keep documentation in Russian when extending existing Russian docs unless the user asks
  otherwise.
- Keep this file in English so tool-facing project guidance stays compact and easy to scan.
- Prefer explicit SQL column lists over `SELECT *` in persistent logic.
- Keep generated or sample data small and safe for Git.
- Follow existing YAML changelog style before introducing new abstractions.
